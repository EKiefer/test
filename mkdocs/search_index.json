Chlorine is a disinfectent--which means it inactivates pathogens \n(many of them, but not all of them)\n. Although it can be purchased in several different forms, we purchase it in the form of sodium hypochlorite (NaClO).\n\n\n\n\nStrength \n\n\nWe purchase sodium hypochlorite that is approximately 12.5% active (by weight). It can also be expressed as 15% active (by volume). This means that 1 pound of sodium hypochlorite solution will have about 0.125 lbs of active chlorine. Likewise, 1 gallon of sodium hypochlorite of bleach will consist of 0.15 active gallons.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou should note that the title will be automatically capitalized.",
